## About The Project

In this project we learned how to use JavaScript at a higher level. We learned about APIs and what they do. I had trouble with the sorting and filtering because I was in the hospital with my lung that had burst. This is also why my work is not at the standard it was last term. I did try and implement the code but something was off.
